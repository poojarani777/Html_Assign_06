            <h2>What is AbhishekCoin</h2>
            <b>The post should be treated as an article with two sections, titled What is AbhishekCoin and Where Do I
                Start?, respectively. Each section should have a paragraph of text (the text directly below the
                respective section title in the starting code), and the sections should be divided by a horizontal rule.

            <h2>Where do I start</h2>
            <p>In the first section, the text proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm should be marked up as
                strong text, and Web 4.0 should be emphasized. In the second section, the word AbhishekCoin should be a
                link to https://algoexpert.io, and it should open in a new tab.</p>
